            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Christian, welcome to my personal website.</p>

            <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>I'm a son, brother, husband, father and web developer. I build websites for a living and help bridge the gap between people and technology.</p>
            
            <p>I care about how things work and how people find things. This has led me down a digital marketing/SEO path which I've been exploring and playing in for over 15 years. Most recently I've enjoyed playing with Gen AI tools such as Gemini, Claude Code, and n8n.</p>

            <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>I build websites and digital experiences for businesses and individuals. My work focuses on creating user-friendly, accessible, and high-performing web applications.</p>

            <h3>My Interests</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sailing</li>
                <li>Gaming</li>
                <li>Coding</li>
                <li>Dancing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>I've always been an entrepreneur at heart. Right out of high school I started an iphone screen repair business, and later a web development and computer repair business.</p>

            <p>After college I started a digital marketing agency with my best friend. Now I'm working at Tallo helping them get in front of their target audience through strategic web architecture and digital marketing.</p>
