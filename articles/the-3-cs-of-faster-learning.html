        <h1>Learn Faster With These 3 C-Words</h1>
        <p>I was going to copy paste a response from Gemini, but I decided against it and chose to write this article myself. Let's see how it goes.</p>
        
    </header>

    <main>
        <section>
            <h2>What are the 3 C's of Faster Learning?</h2>
            <p>The 3 C's are Compress, Connect and Commit. I must admit, just before writing this, I had to ask Gemini what they were again cause I forgot the last 2. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial-position_effect#Primacy_effect" target="_blank">Primacy effect</a> anyone? I guess I should define each like AI does huh?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compress: to shrink the volume of information down to the most important bits. Loo up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank">pareto principle</a>, it's invaluable here. This stage is always overcooked. Don't over cook this step.</li>
                <li>Connect: take what you're learning and associate it to something you already know.For example, like I don't know, I think of code flow like water rushing through a pipe system with different valves or something... I don't know why I used that as an example. I don't know much about code flow or pipes, LOL.</li>
                <li>Commit: My understanding here is weakest, but it's like testing yourself or something. I guess it's what I'm doing with this blog. Testing my ability to regurgitate information as a qualifier to my own understanding? Ok, next section!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Who I learned these from - The MIT Monk YT</h2>
            <p>Originally I learned this framework from a youtube video titled, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npQ2IORdlvU" target="_blank">"How to Learn So Fast It's Almost Unfair"</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theMITmonk" target="_blank">theMITmonk</a> <em>I love that guy</em>.</p>
            <h2>Why I think they're important</h2>
            <p>To quote Steven Segal, <em>"everybody want to be the master, but no body want to put in the work."</em> I don't know if he actually said that, but I'm pretty sure I saw it in a movie of his. Anyways, mastery is sexy. E.g. knowing how to dance salsa like a pro - hot. Learning to dance salsa, not hot. Trust me. However, <strong>*Proper*</strong> learning is the furthest thing from sexy. It's annoying, ugly, demoralizing, hard, enfuriating even (if done correctly). But if you want mastery, you gotta get through the ugly stage. I think if there's a way to make the ugly stage as <em>*short*</em> as possible, sign me up.</p>
            <h2>How I am using the 3 C's in 2026</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Compress: Applying pareto to my AI prompts, <em>"What's the 20% of [THIS] that I need to learn in order to get 80% of the benefit."</em> I'm guilty of overdoing this, big time.</li>
                <li>Connect: I could do a better job of this. Example coming soon...</li>
                <li>Commit: I write a blog post about something that I am learning or have learned recently. You're reading it!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Thoughts on primacy effect</h2>
            <p>This is a thought that occurred to me after I asked what the other 2 C's were in my research, <em>"Why do I only remember the 1st C?"</em>. After some more research, I rediscovered the primacy effect. I linked the wikipedia page to it earlier. But I find this concept fascinating (wow that work was tough to spell, fask-in-ating). How many other things are we overly prioritizing just because its first on the list, what are we underdeveloping?</p>
            <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
            <p>If you're reading this, I'm sorry. JK, I'm doing this for me. For my learning journey. But I'm writing it down so what I learn in my life doesn't just die with me. I would like to have something to leave the world after I'm gone.</p>
            <p>Thanks for reading this post by Christian Gomez, see you next time.</p>
